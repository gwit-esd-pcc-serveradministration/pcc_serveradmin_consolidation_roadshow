# PCC Server Administration: Team Changes

---
## When
- **January 22, 2024**
    - on-call calendar changes on that date
    - remedy and tufin may change earlier
---
## What’s changing ?
- Merging Windows and Linux Teams
  - **Enterprise Server Management**
- VMware Team becomes 
  - **Virtualization and Infrastructure Management**

---
## Why change ?
- Cloud alignment
- Large Numbers of Servers, Common Tasks
- Remove vendor dependent names
- EX: The VMWare team manages storage, internal networking, cloud interoperabilty, and the hypervisor(vmware)

---
## The Year Ahead
- January 2024: Jr. Admins
  - OS Admins can triage and perform basic troubleshooting
- Summer 2024: Simple Operations
  - Common operations shared, vm lifecycle, patching, snapshots, etc.
- Winter 2024/25: Fully Shared Operations
  - Configuration element work shared, SCCM, Puppet, GPOs, etc.

---
## How will this affect me ?
- The winadmin, vmware, and sagchat email addresses will be retired.
- Replaced with:
  - pcc_serveradmin@gwu.edu (whole team)
  - srvmgmt@email.gwu.edu (server management)
  - virtmgmt@email.gwu.edu (virtualization and infrastructure)
- The On-Call Calendar Changes
- Remedy, Tufin hosts simplified, MS Teams tags
- Meet New People

---
## What can I do to help ?
- Be patient, we’re learning.
- Use the new email addresses and team names.
- Honor the on-call calendar, call the secondary if the primary doesn’t answer.
  - DO NOT PICK based on known skill set.
- Submit firewall tickets, it’s a logistical drain on the admins
- Collaborate for application architecture diagrams.
- Learn with us.
